# Project Brief: Letterüìù V1

## Executive Summary

Letterüìù is an emotional communication service that bridges the digital-to-physical gap by allowing users to compose letters online for physical delivery. Version 1 (V1) evolves from the initial proof-of-concept by introducing a powerful suite of "ghostwriter" features designed to help users articulate their feelings perfectly. This includes pre-written templates, AI-powered writing assistance, and contextual prompts. V1 aims to solve not only the impersonal nature of digital communication but also the challenge of writer's block, making it easier than ever to send a meaningful physical letter.

## Problem Statement

In today's hyper-connected world, communication has become instantaneous but increasingly impersonal. While the desire for authentic connection remains strong, many people struggle to find the right words for important moments, leading to valuable thoughts being left unsaid. Existing digital solutions lack the warmth of a physical letter, and the act of writing can be daunting. There is a clear need for a service that not only provides the convenience of digital composition and physical delivery but also actively assists the user in the creative and emotional labor of writing.

## Proposed Solution

Letterüìù V1 will enhance the core V0 experience by deeply integrating "ghostwriter" capabilities. The solution will empower users to express themselves more effectively through a three-pronged approach:

1.  **Guided Creation**: Users can select from a library of professionally written templates for various occasions (e.g., condolences, celebrations, apologies) as a starting point.
2.  **AI-Powered Assistance**: As users write, they can opt-in to receive AI-driven suggestions to improve phrasing, adjust tone, or find more impactful words.
3.  **Inspirational Prompts**: For users facing a blank page, the service will offer creative writing prompts and guides to help them begin and structure their thoughts.

These features will be seamlessly integrated into the existing composition flow, transforming the product from a simple delivery tool into a comprehensive creative partner for heartfelt communication.

## Target Users

The target users remain the "Heartfelt Communicator" and the "Nostalgic Correspondent" identified in V0, but the V1 features will specifically appeal to users who may have previously been hesitant to write due to lack of time, confidence, or inspiration.

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Business Objectives
- Increase the letter completion rate by 25% compared to V0.
- Achieve a 20% adoption rate for at least one of the new "ghostwriter" features within the first 3 months of launch.
- Gather qualitative feedback from V1 users to validate the effectiveness of the writing assistance tools.

### User Success Metrics
- High user satisfaction scores (CSAT) related to the writing experience.
- A measurable reduction in the average time spent in the composition phase for users who engage with assistance features.
- Anecdotal evidence that users feel more confident and empowered in their writing.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Feature Adoption Rate:** Percentage of users engaging with templates, AI suggestions, or prompts.
- **Conversion Funnel:** Track users from starting a letter, using a feature, to successful submission.
- **User Retention:** Measure how many V1 users return to send a second letter.

## V1 Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)
- All features from V0 (composition, stamp selection, submission, admin review).
- **Writing Templates:** A browsable library of letter templates for different categories.
- **AI Writing Assistant:** An opt-in feature within the `tiptap` editor providing real-time suggestions.
- **Writing Prompts:** A feature to display contextual prompts or questions to inspire the user.
- **User Accounts & History:** Simple user login/signup to view past letters and save drafts.

### Out of Scope for V1
- B2B/Corporate features.
- Advanced customization of physical materials (paper, ink).
- Letter scheduling for future dates.
- Digital sending or sharing of letters.

### V1 Success Criteria
V1 will be successful if the new writing assistance features lead to a statistically significant increase in completed orders and receive positive user feedback confirming their value in overcoming writer's block and improving the final message.

## Post-V1 Vision

### Phase 2 Features
- Expansion into a B2B service for personalized corporate mailings.
- Introduction of a native mobile app.
- Partnerships with artists and writers for exclusive template and stamp collections.

### Long-term Vision
To become the definitive platform for meaningful communication, blending human creativity with AI assistance to preserve and elevate the art of letter writing.

## Technical Considerations

### Technology Preferences
- **Frontend:** `Next.js`
- **Database:** `PostgreSQL`
- **Editor:** `tiptap`
- **AI/ML:** Integration with a third-party Large Language Model (LLM) API (e.g., Google AI, OpenAI) for writing suggestions.

### Architecture Considerations
- The "ghostwriter" services should be designed as a distinct module that can be updated independently.
- A secure and scalable solution for managing API keys and interactions with the third-party LLM provider is required.

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints
- Budget and timeline for V1 to be determined.
- Dependency on a third-party AI provider for core functionality.

### Key Assumptions
- Users will find AI writing suggestions helpful and not intrusive.
- The cost of using a third-party LLM API will be manageable within the business model.
- The introduction of user accounts will not create significant friction for new users.

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks
- **Quality of AI Suggestions:** Poor or generic AI suggestions could detract from the user experience.
- **Cost Overruns:** Unanticipated high usage of the LLM API could lead to significant operational costs.
- **Data Privacy:** Clear policies must be established regarding what data is sent to the third-party AI for processing.

### Open Questions
- What is the right business model for V1? (e.g., a flat fee, a subscription, or a per-feature charge?)
- How do we ensure the AI's tone aligns with the user's personal voice?
- What is the content policy for AI-generated text?

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1.  Develop wireframes and prototypes for the new "ghostwriter" features.
2.  Evaluate and select a third-party LLM provider.
3.  Draft a detailed PRD for the V1 scope.
4.  Update the privacy policy to include data handling for AI features.
